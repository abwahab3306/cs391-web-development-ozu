Our Project idea is about making a course registration system for students. The website will consist of 3 webpages. The login page. The course registration page and a third page where the students can view the courses they have taken.

Website will aldo contain two pages for teacher.
- login 
- courses 
Teachers can add courses 


The other necessary constraints like max name length and email syntax, etc will also be implemented.
